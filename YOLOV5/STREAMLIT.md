## Streamlit Interface Overview

The project features an intuitive Streamlit interface designed for seamless interaction with the AI-powered image segmentation and object identification pipeline. Users can easily upload images, run the entire processing pipeline, and view the results directly in their browser.

The interface displays the original image with annotated bounding boxes, segmented objects with generated descriptions, and a summary table. Additionally, users can download a CSV file containing detailed information about the detected objects, including their bounding boxes, confidence scores, class IDs, and automatically generated captions. The interface provides a user-friendly way to explore and analyze images with powerful AI tools, making it accessible even for those without technical expertise.
